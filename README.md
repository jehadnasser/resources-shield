# Resources-Shield
This Operator protects namespaces in your cluster, and protect its own resources as well

## How it works
to start the test run this script:
```sh
./bootstrap.sh
```

## What's next?
- find a way to stop this operator when I need to really delete?
- does fluxCD will keep them exists? or do I need a specific controller for this operator?
